Game of life for scrollbot <br>
Only the files web_launch.py and game_of_life.py are needed from this project to run the game of life on your scrollbot <br>
https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/assembling-scroll-bot <br>

Firstly, install flask and the scrollphathd module (from pimoroni) on your pi zero <br>
Then copy web_launch.py and game_of_life.py to a folder on your pi zero <br>

Note: Do not use scrollphathd.py from this repository, this is just a debug file for testing on a machine that does not have a Scroll pHAT HD LED readout, you know, like your computer!

run web_launch.py then go to a browser and open the web page <br>
then click 'Start Process'

Enjoy!
